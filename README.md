# Java GUI – ToDo App (Elevate Labs Task-6)

## Overview
This project is a simple **Java Swing GUI application** that lets the user manage a To-Do list.  
It was built as part of the Elevate Labs Java Developer Internship (Task-6).

Features:
- Add a new task.
- Delete a selected task.
- View all tasks in a scrollable list.

## Tools & Technologies
- Java (JDK 8+)
- Swing (JFrame, JTextField, JButton, JList, DefaultListModel, JScrollPane)
- Eclipse IDE

## Project Structure
```
ElevateLabsInternship/
└── src/
└── com.elevatelabs.tasks.task6/
└── TodoApp.java
```

## How to Run:
1. Open the project in **Eclipse IDE** (or any Java IDE).
2. Make sure you have at least JDK 8 installed.
3. Run `TodoApp.java` as a Java Application.
4. A window appears where you can:
   - Type a task in the text box and click **Add Task**.
   - Select a task from the list and click **Delete Selected Task**.

## What I Did in This Task
- Created a **Swing GUI window (JFrame)** for the ToDo application.
- Added a text field (`JTextField`) for entering tasks.
- Used a **list component (`JList`)** with `DefaultListModel` to display tasks.
- Implemented **Add** and **Delete** functionality using `ActionListener` on buttons.
- Followed a simple layout with `BorderLayout` and `JPanel` for clean UI.

## Concepts Learned
- Basics of **Java Swing GUI programming**.
- Using **JFrame, JPanel, JTextField, JButton, JList**.
- Handling **button click events** with `ActionListener`.
- Using `DefaultListModel` to manage list data dynamically.
- Simple **layout management** with `BorderLayout`.
